# BP-sex-specific-pleiotropy
## Description:
The purpose of this implementation is to identify BP-associated regions with sex-specific pleiotropy in relation to a cardiovascular disease (CVD) trait, using the GWAS data provided by the user. We employ sex-stratified genetic associations for systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), or pulse pressure (PP) from the UK Biobank (UKB) dataset, with equal sample sizes for different sexes, to conduct cross-trait GWAS colocalization. This analysis is specifically focused on the top BP loci regions identified in the BP GWAS.
Based on the comparison of colocalization posterior probabilities, we can pinpoint BP candidate regions with sex-specific and sex-biased pleiotropy with the CVD trait of interest (ML Yang, et al.).
